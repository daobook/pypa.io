"The :ref:`distutils` cross-platform build and distribution system was "
"added to the Python standard library in late 2000. This means the current"
" Python software distribution ecosystem (which builds on "
":ref:`distutils`) has a foundation that is almost 15 years old, which "
"poses a variety of challenges to successful evolution."
msgstr ""
":ref:`distutils` 跨平台构建和发布系统在 2000 年底被添加到 Python 标准库中。"
"这意味着目前的 Python 软件发布生态系统（建立在 :ref:`distutils` 上）"

"The current effort to improve the situation started when the "

"into the standard library for Python 3.3.  That effort had spanned from "
